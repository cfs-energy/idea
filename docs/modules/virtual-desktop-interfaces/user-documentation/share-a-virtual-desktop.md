# Share a virtual desktop

As virtual desktop owner, you do have the option to share your session with other IDEA users.&#x20;

While sharing your session, you have the choice to configure what permissions you want to assign to your collaborator(s). For example, you can give read-only access to a team-mate with who you are doing live troubleshooting or give additional permissions if you need to share the session with your global IT team.

## How to share a virtual desktop

To share your session, click "**Actions**" **>** "**Session Permissions**" on the virtual desktop you are planning to share. This will open a new modal where you can choose the user(s) you want to share your desktop with, as well as the permissions to assign to the shared session and the expiration time.
