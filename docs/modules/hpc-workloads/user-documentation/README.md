# HPC Workloads: User Documentation

This section provides documentation for users working with HPC (High-Performance Computing) workloads in the IDEA platform.

## Job Submission Options

IDEA offers multiple ways to submit and manage your HPC jobs:

* **Web-based Form Submission**: Use the intuitive web interface to submit jobs using predefined forms
* **Script Workbench**: Create and submit custom PBS job scripts directly from the web interface
* **Command Line (qsub)**: Submit jobs via SSH using the standard PBS commands
* **REST API**: Programmatically submit and manage jobs using the IDEA API
