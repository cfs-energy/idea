# Admin Documentation

HPC workload administrators have extensive capabilities to manage job submission, queue profiles, and resource allocation in IDEA. This section covers the key administrative tasks and features.

{% hint style="info" %}
**New Feature**: All tables in the HPC Workloads module now support alphanumeric sorting, making it easier to find and organize resources. Simply click on any column header to sort the table by that column.
{% endhint %}

## Administrative Features

* [Queue Profiles](queue-profiles.md) - Configure job execution environments and default parameters
* [Web-Based Job Submission](create-web-based-job-submission-workflows.md) - Create custom forms for simplified job submission
* [License Resources](configure-floating-license-resources.md) - Manage floating license resources for applications
* [OpenPBS Hooks](openpbs-hooks.md) - Understand and configure OpenPBS hooks used by IDEA

## Key Administrative Capabilities

### Budget Management

The Submit Job page now includes a Budget tab that provides visibility into project budget consumption. This feature helps users understand their spending limits before submitting jobs. Administrators can configure budgets for projects to control costs and prevent overspending. See [Set Up Budget Per Project](../../best-practices/budget/set-up-budget-per-project.md) for details.

### Job Submission Forms

Administrators can create custom web-based job submission forms that simplify the job submission process for users. These forms can include validation, default values, and dynamic fields based on user selections. See [Web-Based Job Submission](create-web-based-job-submission-workflows.md) for details.
