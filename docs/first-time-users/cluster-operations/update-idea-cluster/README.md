# Update IDEA cluster

Follow the guides below based on the type of update you want to apply to your IDEA cluster:

* [patch-idea-module.md](patch-idea-module.md "mention") if you have updated the codebase of one of your module (e.g: developed new API, updated a function/class)
* [update-idea-configuration.md](update-idea-configuration.md "mention") if you want to make a configuration change (e.g: enable SES, point DCV driver to a new version ...)&#x20;
* [update-idea-backend-resource.md](update-idea-backend-resource.md "mention") if you have made an architecture update outside of IDEA codebase (e.g: updated Lambda function, create new shared filesystem  ...)
