# Configure your OpenSearch

## Access your OpenSearch endpoint

Run `idea-admin.sh show-connection-info --aws-region <REGION> --cluster-name <NAME>` command to retrieve the "**Analytic Dashboard**" URL.

```bash
$ ./idea-admin.sh show-connection-info --aws-region us-east-2 --cluster-name idea-mcdev
Web Portal: xx
Bastion Host (SSH Access): xx
Bastion Host (Session Manager URL): xx
Analytics Dashboard: https://idea-mcdev-external-alb-391482262.us-east-2.elb.amazonaws.com/_dashboards

```

Alternatively, you can retrieve the OpenSearch dashboard endpoint via your IDEA Web Interface > "**Cluster** **Management**" > "**Settings**" then "**Analytics**".

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Virtual Desktop Index" %}
## **User Sessions**

**As Index Pattern Name**, specify your cluster name followed by "**\_vdc\_user\_sessions\***". For example, if your cluster name is "idea-test" then search for "idea-test\__vdc\__user\_sessions\*". Once done, click "**Next Step**".

Use "**created\_on**" as Time Field then click "**Create Index Pattern"**
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Scale-Out Workloads Index" %}
## **Compute Nodes**

**As Index Pattern Name**, specify your cluster name followed by "**\_scheduler\_nodes\***". For example, if your cluster name is "idea-test" then search for "idea-test\_scheduler\_nodes\*". Once done, click "**Next Step**".

Use "**provisioning\_time**" as Time Field then click "**Create Index Pattern"**

##

## Job Information

**As Index Pattern Name**, specify your cluster name followed by "**\_scheduler\_jobs\***". For example, if your cluster name is "idea-test" then search for "_idea-test\_scheduler\_jobs\*"_. Once done, click "**Next Step**".

Use "**queue\_time**" as Time Field then click "**Create Index Pattern"**
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## Validate the index

Once your index is created, click the hamburger menu to open the sidebar and click "**Discover**" within the "**OpenSearch Dashboards**" section.

## Troubleshooting access permission[Â¶](https://awslabs.github.io/scale-out-computing-on-aws/analytics/monitor-cluster-activity/#troubleshooting-access-permission) <a href="#troubleshooting-access-permission" id="troubleshooting-access-permission"></a>

Access to OpenSearch is restricted to the IP you have specified during the installation. If your IP change for any reason, you won't be able to access the analytics dashboard and will get the following error message:

```
{"Message":"User: anonymous is not authorized to perform: es:ESHttpGet"}
```

To solve this issue, log in to AWS Console and go to OpenSearch Service dashboard. Select your OpenSearch  cluster and click "Modify Access Policy"

Finally, simply add your new IP under the "Condition" block, then click Submit
