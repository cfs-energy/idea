# Integrated Digital Engineering on AWS

**Read Me First**

IDEA is **NOT** supported by AWS. Do **NOT** expect support from AWS for IDEA. If you're looking for a supported solution, please look to AWS RES.

AWS has decided to take a different direction with IDEA and pursue RES (https://github.com/aws/res). Until RES achieves feature parity with IDEA, this repository will be the authoritative source for IDEA updates, patches, and information.

This project is NOT AWS RES (https://github.com/aws/res). RES is a fork of IDEA and not all IDEA features made it to RES. RES Documentation is available on https://docs.aws.amazon.com/res/latest/ug/overview.html

This solution collects anonymous operational metrics to help AWS improve the quality of the solution.
