## [25.06.2] - 2025-06-17

### **üîß Critical Hotfixes**

This maintenance release addresses critical stability and compatibility issues in the Virtual Desktop Controller (VDC) and Cluster Manager components.

**Upgrade Instructions:**
* From `25.05.1`: Update only `vdc` and `cluster-manager` (non-service impacting)
```bash
./idea-admin.sh upgrade-cluster cluster-manager vdc --aws-region $IDEA_AWS_REGION --cluster-name $IDEA_CLUSTER_NAME
```
* From other versions: Run full `upgrade-cluster` ([documentation](https://docs.idea-hpc.com/first-time-users/cluster-operations/update-idea-cluster/upgrade-cluster))

### **üîÑ Updates**
* Software Stack and Base AMIs updated
* Fixed changelog link typos

### **üêõ Bug Fixes**

* **TailFile API Optimization**: Refactored to reduce memory consumption and prevent OOM crashes in cluster-manager supervisord process
* **Windows Server 2025 GPU Support**: Fixed NVIDIA GPU compatibility by using Windows Server 2022 drivers (Windows Server 2025 drivers not yet available from AWS)

## [25.06.1] - 2025-06-10

> **üìã TL;DR - KEY HIGHLIGHTS**
> - üö® **Breaking:** Amazon Linux 2 no longer supported for Infrastructure Base OS
> - üìÖ **Versioning:** Switched to CalVer from Semantic Versioning
> - üõ†Ô∏è **New Tool:** Unified `upgrade-cluster` command for easier upgrades
> - üíª **OS Support:** Added AL2023, Windows Server 2022/2025, Ubuntu 22.04/24.04
> - ‚ö° **Major Feature:** Script Workbench for PBS job creation in Web UI

* This release marks the change to [CalVer](https://calver.org/) from Semantic Versioning

### **‚ö†Ô∏è BREAKING CHANGES** - Read Carefully!

**Amazon Linux 2 Support for Infrastructure Base OS Removed**
* Amazon Linux 2 is no longer supported as an Infrastructure Base OS
* **Action Required:** The new `upgrade-cluster` tool will assist with updating the Base OS and AMI for Infrastructure Hosts as part of the upgrade process
* **New Default:** Amazon Linux 2023 is now the default for new installs

### **üöÄ Upgrade Paths**

There are two recommended upgrade paths:

1. **‚≠ê Recommended: Use the new unified upgrade-cluster command** (simplest approach)
   ```bash
   ./idea-admin.sh upgrade-cluster \
     --aws-region us-east-2 \
     --cluster-name idea-test1
   ```
   This command handles all the necessary steps including base OS updates, global settings backup and regeneration, and module upgrades in a single operation.

   Detailed information about the `upgrade-cluster` command can be found in the [IDEA Upgrade Documentation](https://docs.idea-hpc.com/first-time-users/cluster-operations/update-idea-cluster/upgrade-cluster).

2. **Alternative: Manual update process**

   If you prefer more control over the upgrade process, follow the detailed instructions in the [IDEA Upgrade Documentation](https://docs.idea-hpc.com/first-time-users/cluster-operations/update-idea-cluster/update-idea-backend-resource).

### **üìã Post Upgrade**

**Merge Software Stacks (Optional)**

   After completing the upgrade, you can run `ideactl merge-software-stacks` from the VDC Controller to merge new default software stacks from the release into your cluster.

## **üÜï Major New Features**

### **Script Workbench**
Added [Script Workbench](https://docs.idea-hpc.com/modules/hpc-workloads/user-documentation/script-workbench) - a game-changing feature that allows users to create, validate (dry run), and submit PBS job scripts directly from the Web UI with real-time directive validation and cost estimation.

### **Expanded Operating System Support**

## [3.1.10] - 2024-10-29

### Notes
* This upgrade does require an update to the global settings. Please review [Global Settings Upgrade](https://docs.idea-hpc.com/first-time-users/cluster-operations/update-idea-cluster/update-idea-backend-resource#global-settings-backup-and-upgrade) before upgrading.
* You should update the IDEA CDK Bootstrap to fix [CDK Issue #31885](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/issues/31885) - This is a security fix and should be addressed on all CDK stacks regardless of IDEA
  * To update the IDEA CDK Bootstrap for existing deployments, use idea-admin:
    ```
    idea-admin.sh bootstrap --cluster-name <CLUSTER_NAME> --aws-region <CLUSTER_REGION> --aws-profile <AWS_PROFILE>
    ```

### Features

* Fixed Firefox menu entry on Ubuntu
* Fixed OpenSearch Private IP and Target Group logic
* Fixed initial eVDI session creation failing when instances requiring reboot take longer than expected
* Removed `OS_CENTOS7` reference from IDEA Admin Utility

### Known Caveats
* There is no FSx Lustre client for `Ubuntu 24.04` thus any FSx Lustre mounts will not function with `Ubuntu 24.04` eVDI until AWS releases a client
* OpenPBS is compiled from latest code in Github repository when using `Ubuntu 24.04`
* Amazon Windows DCV AMIs are using DCV server `2023.1.17701`

## [3.1.9] - 2024-08-29

### Notes
* DCV session files with no `transport` set have a 1 second timeout where `QUIC` is tried first and then a fallback to `TCP/WS` - In testing, this has found to leverage `QUIC` automatically intermittently when `QUIC` is enabled in IDEA. This will likely be resolved in the future with a customizable timeout to ensure `QUIC` connections complete in time.
* Docs need updating to reflect Ubuntu usage and removal of EOL OS options.

### Features

* Only OpenSearch In-Use IPs should be added to the `dashboard` target group
* Adjusted pagination to `1000` records in `ListUsersInGroup` calls from Cluster Manager Web UI. This should be adjusted in the future to use proper pagination.

### Known Caveats

* When accessing multiple IDEA deployments at once in Safari, SSO logins hang for environments that were loaded after the first. Also exists in prior releases.
* When using SSO and Chrome, inactive tabs time out more quickly than desired. Also exists in prior releases.
* Docs need some updates to reflect addition of Ubuntu and removal of RHEL 7 and CentOS 7

## [3.1.7] - 2024-06-01

### Notes
* This upgrade does require an update to the global settings. Please review [Global Settings Upgrade](https://docs.idea-hpc.com/first-time-users/cluster-operations/update-idea-cluster/update-idea-backend-resource#global-settings-backup-and-upgrade) before upgrading.

* Fixed NVIDIA GPU Driver install for Amazon Linux 2 with Kernel 5.10
* Remove trailing whitespace from ENI IDS for tagging in instance bootstrap
* Fixed HPC Job Name pydantic validation to allow strings, integers, and floats instead of just strings for HPC job names submitted from CLI
* Set PBS config on eVDI Nodes to use the Rt53 scheduler record instead of the ec2 hostname. This will enable existing eVDI nodes to access PBS with an upgraded scheduler with a new ip.
* Fix root storage size calculation for new eVDI nodes with hibernation enabled
* Fix resuming Hibernated eVDI nodes
* Fixed ID Token claims for SSO enabled clusters. Added Cognito pre token generation Lambda to stuff custom attributes to ID token

* Fix scratch storage mount permissions for HPC jobs on Linux
* In `idea-admin.sh` sso configuration, multiple scopes can be submitted separated by `,` this will be replaced with a space in Cognito

### Known Caveats
* Data model was updated in 3.1.6, devtool web-portal.typings needs to be re-worked to support changes in Pydantic v2 and IDEA data model
* Developer documentation needs some re-work / updates
* When using OpenLDAP and doing an upgrade, replacement of the directoryservice instance removes existing directory entries. This can be avoided by backing up and restoring post upgrade or using ideactl on cluster manager to sync groups and users from DynamoDB into OpenLDAP. Generally there is not an explicit need to upgrade the directoryservice module.
* After upgrading the scheduler module, job id's reset to 0. This is purely cosmetic and does not affect functionality. However, users tracking analytics by job id may want to be aware of this upon upgrade.
* Tests need some re-work
* Node dependencies need updating in more places. Cluster Manager Web App
* Python needs updating. 3.9 is EOL October 2025


## [3.1.6] - 2023-10-20

  * **NOTE:** Subscription to `Rocky Linux 9` in AWS Marketplace (https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-ygp66mwgbl2ii) is required to access Rocky Linux AMIs.
  * `Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.2` and `Rocky Linux 9.2` are not currently supported as installation / infrastructure nodes.


### Changes
* Improvements to Active Directory join process for Windows eVDI sessions.
  * Improved debug logging for troubleshooting
  * Add minimum floor of `3` seconds to wait before attempting AD join
  * Auto-retry eVDI Active Directory process to reduce the chance of a join failure in busy environments
  * Active Directory join timers are now controlled with new configuration options
    * `directoryservice.ad_automation.ad_join_min_sleep` - The minimum sleep interval before attempting join (per loop)
    * `directoryservice.ad_automation.ad_join_max_sleep` - The maximum sleep interval before attempting join (per loop)
    * `directoryservice.ad_automation.ad_join_retry_count` - The retry count (loop count) to attempt Active Directory joins
  * Allow the `cluster-manager` to supply an `OU` and `hostname` back to the joining client.
    * This can be used to move `hostname` generation logic and `OU` sorting to `cluster-manager` (customizations required)
    * Auto-rename the host on AD join when `cluster-manager` supplied hostname differs from the hostname
* Dashes (`-`) are now allowed in IDEA usernames
  * Dashes are not permitted at the start or end of a username, or appearing consecutively
* `cluster-manager` will now mask the content of the API request `FileBrowser.SaveFile` (used when editing/saving a file in the browser)

* EFA is not supported on RHEL9
* RHEL9 / Rocky9 is not able to be used as infrastructure nodes (IDEA/NICE DCV application nodes)


## [3.1.5] - 2023-09-06

### Features
* Install XDummy driver for non-gpu Linux console eVDI sessions
* Add command-line options (`--custom-permissions-boundary`, `--cloudformation-execution-policies`, `--public-access-block-configuration`) for `idea-admin.sh bootstrap` sub-command. These are passed to the underlying `cdk bootstrap` command as needed to support IAM permissions boundary and S3 bucket restrictions during the `cdk bootstrap` phase.
  * Users may also need to customize `cdk.json` for the IDEA-created IAM roles to attach IAM permissions boundaries, depending on their specific AWS Account policy. See [this blog post](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/devops/secure-cdk-deployments-with-iam-permission-boundaries/) for additional information regarding AWS CDK and IAM permission boundaries.
* In Active Directory environments - added a cache for discovered Active Directory information (domain controller IP addresses)
* Support added for [HPC7a](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/hpc7a/) and [P5](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/p5/) instance families
* Added `delete-backups` sub-command for `idea-admin.sh`


### Changes
* Update AWS EFA Installer from `1.23.1` to `1.25.1`
* Improve ability for IDEA SDK consumers (such as `scheduler` module) to support newly launched AWS EC2 instances on the same day of launch. This changes the authoritative source of instance type validity from the installed boto3 to the AWS API call `describe_instance_types()` and provides a caching method.
* Adjust Project budget display (and other displays of currency) to be formatted with commas
* Change default instance types to be `m6i` family from `m5` family in keeping with current generations of available instance families. Older family instances can still be updated in the generated YAML configuration files before `config update`.
* Support egress IPv6 traffic in security groups where IPv4-traffic was permitted
* Split apart VDC Broker Security group generation
* Update OpenSearch default engine from `2.3` to `2.7`
* AWS CDK `2.63.0` -> `2.93.0`
* AWS CDK template updates from `v14` to `v18`
* Set the FSx/Lustre filesystem version to `2.15` for newly created filesystems
* Updated default scratch size to `60GiB` in the WebUI (when editing Queue profiles -> EBS Scratch Provider)
* Misc 3rd party package updates

### Bug Fixes
* Fixed missing IAM permission for VDC Controller scheduled event transformer lambda when using a customer-managed KMS key for SQS. This would have impacted the ability for eVDI schedules to apply to sessions.
* Fixed an issue that prevented `Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.7` from launching VDI sessions on `G4ad` instances
* Windows eVDI instances were not correctly tagging their underlying EBS volumes and Elastic Network Interfaces. This has been fixed (Linux eVDI was not impacted)
* HPC Job DryRun functionality was not properly sending EBS Encryption settings. This could cause jobs to fail a DryRun in environments with Service control policies (SCPs) that required Encrypted EBS volumes. The actual job submission would work properly but the DryRun requirement was a gate that was required to be passed first.
* Restore ability to have spaces in the Project `title`
* During `GovCloud` installation - display a list of AWS profiles for the commercial profile versus requiring the user to type it in.
* Correct a defect that was not allowing the selection of Tenancy Choices for a Software stack.
* Improve eVDI subnet retry logic for both Capacity exceptions and Unsupported Instance exceptions
* OpenSearch domains that were not completely deployed were being listed during `idea-admin.sh config generate --existing-resources`
* When generating a stack from a session - make sure to copy the minimum storage and projects from the session. This should restore the ability to create stacks from existing sessions.
* Fixed WebUI modal for Session Sharing permissions appearing with a dark blue header no matter what the selected theme is
* The example configuration displayed in the SSH Access screen was missing the `Hostname` (IP address) when the bastion was deployed in Private subnet scenarios
* Misc PEP cleanups


### Known Caveats

## [3.1.4] - 2023-07-25

:heavy_exclamation_mark: - *Please note the IDEA ECR Repository location has changed as of `3.1.4`*

Users of older `idea-admin.sh` and `idea-admin-windows.ps1` may need to manually update these files for the new repo location (`public.ecr.aws/h5i3y8y1/idea-administrator`).


### Features
* Added support for `Launch Tenancy` for eVDI software stacks. This allows the IDEA administrator to configure [EC2 Launch Tenancy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/auto-scaling-dedicated-instances.html).


### Changes
* Reduced IAM actions for SQS and SNS in scheduler, VDC broker, and VDC Host to least required privileges
* eVDI session tiles now display the Project of the associated eVDI session (along with putting this information in boxes for clarity)
* Updates to the ECR Repo alias/location
* Add additional logging during (`debug` logging profile) for some latency sensitive operations such as Active Directory lookups.


### Bug Fixes
* In Active Directory (AD) environments - the DynamoDB AD automation table would continue to grow and not properly expire old entries.
* In Active Directory environments - an incoming Windows eVDI session was not using the same domain-controller that `cluster-manager` pre-created the object. This could lead to a race condition where the incoming client would fail to join the domain properly as the AD object had not replicated within the domain.
* In Active Directory environments - users were not displayed properly as members of a group on the Active Directory `Member Of` tab within Active Directory Users and Computers.
* Restore AMI IDs for `us-gov-west-1` region (missing since `3.1.3`)
* Fixed a bug that prevented `userdata_customizations.sh` from executing for jobs that require EFA driver to be installed
* Fixed a syntax error in the `robots.txt` on `cluster-manager` that allowed bots to index IDEA.
* Expand skipping service quotas to batch queues when `scheduler.job_provisioning.service_quotas` is set to `False`
* Added missing IAM actions to installer policies
* Project titles were allowed to exceed character limits in some cases. Project titles are now restricted to `3-32` characters.
* Under certain conditions - the `cluster-manager` task manager could have difficulty keeping up with task execution requirements. Additional configuration parameters have been added to address this.


## [3.1.3] - 2023-06-16

### Features

* Added support for `Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.7` and `Rocky Linux 8.7` as supported operating systems for VDI and compute nodes.
  * **NOTE:** Subscription to `Rocky Linux 8` in AWS Marketplace is required to access Rocky Linux AMIs.

* `ideactl` now supports adding multiple users to multiple named groups in a single command. For example: `ideactl groups add-user-to-group --username user1 --username user2 --groupname group1 --groupname group2`  will add both `user1`  and `user2`  to groups `group1` and `group2`
* Added support for new instance families: `i4g`, `inf2`, and `trn1n`
* eVDI session startup now validates that there is remaining budget for the associated project. If there is no remaining budget a session cannot be started for the project. This is controlled via the new configuration setting `vdc.controller.enforce_project_budgets`  (defaults to `True` ).

### Changes

* Update boto3 from `1.26.61` to `1.26.138`
* Update requests module from `2.27.1` to `2.31.0`
* ALB deployments will now set the option to Drop Invalid Headers
* Default Web/API page size increased from `20` to `50`
